# Contributing to dbt-ui

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **dbt-ui** — a modern web-based interface for `dbt-core` projects. Your ideas, questions, and improvements are always welcome!

## Step 0: Check Existing Work

Before starting anything new, search our:
- [Discussions](https://github.com/data-diving/dbt-ui/discussions)
- [Issues](https://github.com/data-diving/dbt-ui/issues)

This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures we're aligned on priorities.

## Step 1: Start with a Discussion

If you haven't found your issue or suggestion already discussed in there, then start a conversation:

- Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/data-diving/dbt-ui/discussions) tab to ask questions, share ideas, or describe a possible bug or enhancement.
- This helps confirm if:
  - The behavior is indeed a bug,
  - There's already a fix or workaround,
  - Or the proposal aligns with our roadmap.

Our goal is to keep the conversation open and constructive before moving to implementation.

## Step 2: Confirm the Issue

Once a discussion reaches a clear conclusion:

- A **maintainer** or **discussion author** may open a corresponding **GitHub Issue** summarizing:
  - What was confirmed,
  - Why it matters,
  - And what the next steps are.

Each issue should represent a concrete, actionable item — whether that’s fixing a confirmed bug or adding an agreed-upon feature.

## Step 3: Submit a Pull Request

When you’re ready to contribute code:

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and include tests if applicable.
3. Verify that your pull request **links to a confirmed issue** using a GitHub keyword (e.g. `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`).

This ensures every PR corresponds to an approved item and keeps the development process transparent.

## 💙 Community Principles

- Be respectful and patient in discussions.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness — readable code helps everyone.
- Provide context when reporting bugs or suggesting improvements (logs, screenshots, versions, browser info, etc.).

By contributing, you help make **dbt-ui** more robust, transparent, and easier to use for everyone in the community.  
Thank you for helping shape this project! 🙌
